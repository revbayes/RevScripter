## This example is based on the clades selected in the
## file "clades_example_screenshot.png"

# First, create a variable for each clade.
# This will use the name created by the user
# So this probably means, we may have to pay attention to ways
# that user-given names may be problematic. 
# I think it makes sense for each of these to have a prefix (taxset_)


taxset_G1 = clade("Ailuropoda_melanoleuca", "Tremarctos_ornatus")
taxset_G2 = clade("Tremarctos_ornatus", "Helarctos_malayanus",
				  "Melursus_ursinus", "Ursus_americanus")
taxset_G3 = clade("Ursus_arctos", "Ursus_thibetanus")
taxset_G4 = clade("Ursus_arctos","Ursus_thibetanus", "Ursus_maritimus")

# Next, we will handle the monophyletic constraints.
# So the following will only apply to those that have Monophyletic == TRUE
# Though, if we want to really don anything with these, we will deal 
# with them in the Tree Model window.

monophyl_constraints = v(taxset_G2, taxset_G4)
